**ROL‑S — Rudra’s Open License (Secure)**
=========================================

**Version 1.0.0**

_A commercial‑safe, enterprise‑grade license built on ROL‑F, designed to protect creators, users, and open‑source businesses through secure reciprocity, anti‑loophole rules, and professional‑level safeguards._

**1\. Grant of Permission**
---------------------------

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Software, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and redistribute the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, **for open‑source, non‑proprietary, non‑commercial, and community‑aligned purposes**, subject to the conditions of this license.

All permissions from ROL‑F apply unless modified by this license.

**2\. Secure Reciprocity Rule (Mandatory ROL‑S Licensing)**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Any use of the Software **inside any other codebase**, including but not limited to:

*   linking
    
*   importing
    
*   embedding
    
*   compiling
    
*   bundling
    
*   integrating
    
*   wrapping
    
*   calling through APIs
    
*   using across multiple codebases for the same product
    

…requires that **the entire combined or dependent codebase be licensed under ROL‑S**.

This requirement applies whether or not the Software is modified.

### **2.1 Exception for the Original Author**

The Original Author may use the Software in proprietary or closed‑source codebases they own, provided they do not violate the fairness and security rules of this license.

Any other party must license all combined works under ROL‑S.

**3\. Anti‑Sherlocking Clause**
-------------------------------

The Software may not be used to:

*   replicate its functionality
    
*   create a competing product
    
*   replace the Original Author’s business
    
*   integrate into a commercial platform
    
*   provide equivalent features in a closed or monetized system
    

Any attempt to “sherlock” the Software is a **high‑level violation**.

**4\. Anti‑Loophole Clause**
----------------------------

The following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   using wrapper layers to bypass reciprocity
    
*   using micro‑modifications to claim originality
    
*   using service layers to avoid releasing source
    
*   using plugin or module boundaries to hide proprietary parts
    
*   using multiple codebases to conceal closed components
    
*   using API boundaries to avoid open‑source obligations
    
*   using build‑time or runtime indirection to obscure usage
    

Any attempt to circumvent the intent or requirements of this license is a **high‑level violation**.

**5\. Professional Security Requirements**
------------------------------------------

Any distribution, modification, or use of the Software must comply with professional security standards, including:

*   no malicious code
    
*   no telemetry without explicit user consent
    
*   no backdoors
    
*   no obfuscation intended to hide harmful behavior
    
*   no insecure builds
    
*   no deceptive or harmful modifications
    

Violations of this section are **high‑level violations**.

**6\. Community Reciprocity Requirement**
-----------------------------------------

Any Modified or Derived Work must be distributed under ROL‑S.Modified files must remain open‑source and publicly accessible.

New, original files created by the User may be licensed under any terms, provided they do not create a closed, proprietary, commercial, or SaaS‑restricted version of the Software.

**7\. Prohibited Uses**
-----------------------

The Software may not be used for:

*   closed‑source or proprietary distribution
    
*   SaaS models that do not release modifications
    
*   commercial exploitation
    
*   open‑core models
    
*   systems that remove user freedom
    
*   monetization, restriction, or exploitation of the community
    
*   harmful or malicious purposes
    

All permitted uses must remain **free, open‑source, and non‑commercial**.

**8\. Patent Rights**
---------------------

The Original Author grants a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free patent license for all open‑source uses under this license.

This patent license terminates if the User initiates patent litigation against the Original Author.

**9\. Conditions: Full Attribution Without Trademarks**
-------------------------------------------------------

Any distribution must include:

1.  The original copyright notice
    
2.  The full text of this license
    
3.  The Original Author’s name
    
4.  Any attribution URL provided by the Original Author

Attribution must **not** contain:

*   trademarked or registered marks of the Original Author
    
*   logos, icons, or branding of the Original Author
    
*   wording implying endorsement or affiliation
    

Attribution must be plain‑text only.

**10\. Violation Categories**
-----------------------------

Violations are classified as:

### **10.1 Low‑Level Violations**

Minor, accidental, or technical violations.

### **10.2 Medium‑Level Violations**

Violations affecting distribution, attribution, or mixing rules but not malicious.

### **10.3 High‑Level Violations**

High‑level violations include:

*   redistributing closed or proprietary versions
    
*   monetizing the Software
    
*   using the Software to exploit users
    
*   filing false or manipulative legal claims
    
*   misusing the “custom rules” exception (Section 13)
    
*   distributing harmful or deceptive versions
    
*   attempting to bypass reciprocity
    
*   violating the Anti‑Sherlocking or Anti‑Loophole clauses
    

**11\. 30‑Day Cure Period (Low and Medium Violations)**
-------------------------------------------------------

For low‑ or medium‑level violations:

1.  The violator has **30 days** from written notice to fully fix the violation.
    
2.  During these 30 days:
    
    *   no legal action may be filed
        
    *   no penalties apply
        
    *   all rights remain active
        
3.  If fixed within 30 days, the violation is resolved and forgotten.
    
4.  If not fixed within 30 days, it becomes a **final violation**.
    

High‑level violations **do not** receive a cure period.

**12\. Consequences for User Violations**
-----------------------------------------

If a User commits a high‑level violation or fails to cure a violation within 30 days:

1.  Their rights under this license begin **progressive termination**, where protections and permissions are removed step‑by‑step.
    
2.  After repeated or severe violations, the User may be required to use the Software only under a **less protective license** chosen by the Original Author.
    
3.  Termination is permanent unless the Original Author restores rights.
    

**13\. Consequences for Original Author Violations**
----------------------------------------------------

If the Original Author commits a high‑level violation or fails to cure a violation within 30 days:

1.  Their special privileges under this license begin **progressive termination**.
    
2.  The community may treat the violation as grounds for legal action.
    
3.  The Original Author may regain protections and privileges through:
    
    *   demonstrated good‑faith behavior
        
    *   community trust
        
    *   transparent correction of the violation
        

The community may restore rights even if the violation is known.

**14\. Custom Rules for Specific Parts of the Code**
----------------------------------------------------

The Original Author may apply custom licensing or legal terms to **specific, limited parts** of the Software.

However, it is a **high‑level violation** if the Original Author:

*   applies custom rules to the entire codebase
    
*   applies custom rules to a substantial portion of the code
    
*   uses custom rules to bypass ROL‑S
    
*   distributes harmful or deceptive code under the guise of “custom rules”
    

If the Original Author commits such a violation, legal action may be taken.

**15\. Anti‑Abuse and Legal Protection Clause**
-----------------------------------------------

No User may initiate or support legal action against the Original Author for the purpose of:

*   gaining rights not granted by this license
    
*   creating false accusations
    
*   manipulating legal systems
    
*   coercing or intimidating the Original Author
    
*   exploiting the community
    

Such actions are **high‑level violations** and result in immediate termination of rights.

-------------------------

The Original Author may choose to provide:

*   no warranty (default)
    
*   limited warranty
    
*   paid warranty

1.  Maximizes openness and user freedom
    
2.  Protects the community
    
3.  Ensures fairness to both User and Original Author
