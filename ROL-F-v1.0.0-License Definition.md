2.  During these 30 days:
    
    *   no legal action may be filed
        
    *   no penalties apply
        
    *   all rights remain active
        
3.  If fixed within 30 days, the violation is resolved and forgotten.
    
4.  If not fixed within 30 days, it becomes a **final violation**.
    

High‑level violations **do not** receive a cure period.

**10\. Consequences for User Violations**
-----------------------------------------

If a User commits a high‑level violation or fails to cure a violation within 30 days:

1.  Their rights under this license begin **progressive termination**, where protections and permissions are removed step‑by‑step.
    
2.  After repeated or severe violations, the User may be required to use the Software only under a **less protective license** chosen by the Original Author.
    
3.  Termination is permanent unless the Original Author restores rights.
    

**11\. Consequences for Original Author Violations**
----------------------------------------------------

If the Original Author commits a high‑level violation or fails to cure a violation within 30 days:

1.  Their special privileges under this license begin **progressive termination**.
    
2.  The community may treat the violation as grounds for legal action.
    
3.  The Original Author may regain protections and privileges through:
    
    *   demonstrated good‑faith behavior
        
    *   community trust
        
    *   transparent correction of the violation
        

The community may restore rights even if the violation is known.

**12\. Custom Rules for Specific Parts of the Code**
----------------------------------------------------

The Original Author may apply custom licensing or legal terms to **specific, limited parts** of the Software.

However, it is a **high‑level violation** if the Original Author:

*   applies custom rules to the entire codebase
    
*   applies custom rules to a substantial portion of the code
    
*   uses custom rules to bypass ROL‑F
    
*   distributes harmful or deceptive code under the guise of “custom rules”
    

If the Original Author commits such a violation, legal action may be taken.

*   creating false accusations
    
*   manipulating legal systems
    
*   coercing or intimidating the Original Author
    
*   exploiting the community
    

Such actions are **high‑level violations** and result in immediate termination of rights.
